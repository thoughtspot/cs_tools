table:
  name: TS_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP
  description: |-
    Previously named: TS_XREF_PRINCIPAL

    This table denotes Group Memberships. Users may be a member of one or more groups. Groups may be nested, in which the Membership Group is the "parent" - as in, principal GroupA is a member of GroupJ.

    The nested relationship between groups' groups is not modeled in the ThoughtSpot TML as the modeling language does not support recursion.
